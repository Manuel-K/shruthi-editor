Shruthi-Editor: An unofficial Editor for the Shruthi hardware synthesizer. For 
informations about the Shruthi, see <http://mutable-instruments.net/shruthi1>. 
Application icon: "saraswati" by Francois Barbut.
Uses RtMidi 2.1.0 by Gary P. Scavone <http://music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/>.


What works:
 - Editing patches.
 - Remotely changing patch options on the Shruthi.
 - Loading/saving patches from/to disk.
 - Fetching/sending patches from/to the Shruthi.
 - Changes made to patch options on the Shruthi change the settings of the
   editor.
 - Generate random patches.
 - Loading/saving full patch sysex.
 - Editing up to (and including) firmware version 1.02


What doesn't work:
 - Automatic fetching/sending, e.g. on loading/saving.
 - Receiving LFO 1/2 rates per CC is strange


Prerequisites:
 Qt5: <http://www.qt.io/>


Compiling under windows (Prerequisites):
To compile it on windows, you need the mingw version of Qt 5.
You can download it from <http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/>.


Compiling:
Run 
> qmake -config release
> make
inside the shruthi-editor source folder.


Note:
If you want to use firmware versions prior to 0.94, you have to open
shruthi-editor.pro and change the line
#DEFINES += PRE094SYSEXHEADER
to
DEFINES += PRE094SYSEXHEADER
